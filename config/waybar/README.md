# diinki aero Taskbar
The taskbar for the diinki aero rice. diinky uses Waybar for the 
taskbar as it has many features, is easy to theme/design, and 
in general works quite well. Documntation is also ez to find and readable.

The taskbar has two versions, one is opaque, and one is transparent.
Make sure to configure the hyprland theme correctly in order to have
background-blur work. You may want to not use the transparent one on batery beacuse it's gpu power hungry.

If you use the hyprland config that is native to the diinki-aero theme,
then everything should work.
