# diinki aero Hyprland config
I've decided to use Hyprland as the tiling window manager of choice for the
'diinki aero' rice. 

These are the config files, everything is well commented, so take a look and
customize everything to your liking.
# My additions:
I setup the screen to work best for 2.8k framework dispaly
Added 3 finger swipe workspace changing 
added Hyprlock 
spacing changes for more things on screen
quit to gdm shortcut
laptop lid switch 
reload hyprland comand- kinda dosen't work but kinda does?
Fility heavy slow vs code shortcut
