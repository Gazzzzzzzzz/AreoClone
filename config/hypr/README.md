# diinki aero Hyprland config
diinky decided to use Hyprland as the tiling window manager of choice for the ```diinki aero``` rice. 
I also use hyprland as I like not having to move my hads off my keyboard while programing.

These are the config files, everything is well commented, so take a look and
customize everything to your liking.
# My additions:
I setup the screen to work best for 2.8k framework dispaly
Added 3 finger swipe workspace changing 
added Hyprlock 
spacing changes for more things on screen
quit to gdm shortcut
laptop lid switch 
reload hyprland comand- kinda dosen't work but kinda does?
Vs code shortcut
